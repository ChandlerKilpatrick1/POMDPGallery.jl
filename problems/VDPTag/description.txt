Van Der Pol Tag. The agent tries to catch a target that moves according to the [Van Der Pol equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Pol_oscillator#Two-dimensional_form). An observation with a noisy bearing to the target can be obtained for a cost, and the agent always moves one unit, but may choose any direction.
